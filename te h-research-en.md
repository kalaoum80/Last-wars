Last Wars - Tech Centre Research

📌 Click on the ⭐ below the screen and save this as a reference. This is REALLY important.  

This message is specifically for those who are Level 27+ with Troop Level 9. (If you’re below this then rush to HQ27 as soon as possible, don’t delay it). It also applies to levels below, so still read on.  

A lot of players rush to HQ Level 30, thinking it’ll automatically make them stronger. Spoiler alert: It won’t. You’ll eventually reach Level 30 it’s just a matter of time.  

But do you really want to be a shiny new HQ 30, only to get wrecked by a Level 26 or 27 player just because they actually worked on their research and you didn’t? Trust me, it happens all the time.  

The key isn’t rushing buildings it’s building real strength. And that comes from research.  

Since this is a long but critical guide, I’ll be splitting it in two mails.  

📌 Part 1 - Covers Development Research, Economy Section, VS Alliance Duel, and Intercity Truck. This helps your overall progression but doesn’t directly impact your squad’s power.  

📌 Part 2 - Covers Hero Research, Units, Garages, and Special Forces (a.k.a. the research that actually makes you stronger in battle).  

🚨 We’re warriors, not farmers. Unless, of course, you want to be a farmer then, by all means, ignore everything I just said.  

--------------------------------------  
🧪 Part 1 - Research That Helps You Progress  

Development Research - Must Haves!  

✔️ Fast Builder I, II, III, IV - Speeds up building construction.  

✔️ Enhanced Research I, II, III, IV → Speeds up research, helping you progress faster. Max these. No excuses.  

Want to Invest More? ⚡  

Survival Skills (Final Research) → This helps a LOT in PvP fights.  

Also, all other upgrades in the Development section should be at least 3/5. You don’t need to max them all, but getting them to 3/5 will make a noticeable difference.  

--------------------------------------  
💰 Economy Research - You’re a Warrior, Not a Farmer  

Want some extra VS points on Day 3? Sure, throw a few cheap upgrades here. Just don’t go overboard.  

Leave it at 0% or 10%? Bad. Max it? Worse. Find a balance. You’re a warrior, not Dave the Farmer. (Apologies if your name is actually Dave).  

If you’re actually gonna invest some here, pick the shovels not the pickaxes, but I wouldn’t recommend going hard here.  

--------------------------------------  
🏆 Alliance Duel VS - MAX IT. PERIOD.  

It’s really not that hard to make points if you got this sorted out!  

It’s free points. It benefits EVERYONE. So please, just max it. No one wants to see me crying cause somebody couldn’t get 2M points on Monday just by doing radars.  

Oh, and if this isn’t maxed, and you’re not opening your 9 chests in VS Alliance, then where exactly do you plan on getting your Valor Badges to upgrade Special Forces? Magic? Wishful thinking?  

--------------------------------------  
🚛 Intercity Truck - Let Go of Rudolf  

Yes, we all want the reindeer. It’s cute. It’s festive. It’s also NOT what you need right now.  

💡 These upgrades cost Valor Badges, and guess what? Those should be going toward something actually useful. Like, Special Forces.  

🎗️ Rudolf won’t save you in battle. Prioritize strength first.  

📌 But if you’re somehow short on gold for special forces and have an abundance of Valor Badges, then throw some research to get that 5th truck here on Wednesdays.  

--------------------------------------  
📌 Final Reminder  

🚨 This is only Part 1.  

Part 2 will cover:  
- Heros, Units, Garages and Special Forces  

***  

This is Part 2, covering Hero Research, Units, Garages, and Special Forces (aka the research that actually makes you stronger in battle).  

--------------------------------------  
🚗 Garages - What You Should (and Shouldn’t) Upgrade  

❌ Garage II & III - Don’t Touch Them. Not now, not anytime soon. Waste of resources.  

✅ Garage I & Garage IV (For VIP Pass Holders) - Max them ASAP. Not 99%, MAX.  

These garages directly impact your Squad strength and capacity, so stop delaying and get them done.  

Garage 1 impacts Squad 1, Garage 2 impacts Squad 2 and so on. Make sure your squad is placed properly.  

--------------------------------------  
🪖 Units/Soldiers - Raise this or stay weak  

This research strengthens ALL your squads because your troops/Soldiers are included in all your squads, so if you’ve been slacking, fix that.  

📌 At minimum, you should be striving for the last four nodes (75-80% complete, Aim for this).  

--------------------------------------  

The second set of 4 upgrades → At least 3/5.  
They cost more and take longer, but you can’t ignore them.  

👀 You can crawl your way down to the last 4 upgrades, but check the costs first.  

💡 Before upgrading these, check another key upgrade in a different research section that I highlighted earlier. Hint: you put cars in it.  

--------------------------------------  
🪖 Special Forces - The Most Important Research Right Now  

If you haven’t realized it yet, Special Forces research is THE most important thing at this stage.  

Why?  

- It buffs your Level 8/9 troops, making them stronger.  
- It’s the ONLY way to unlock Level 10 troops.  

By now, you should know that squad power alone doesn’t tell the full story. Many hidden factors influence battles, such as:  

- Morale (Special Forces Upgrade) → Higher morale = More damage.  
- Equipment - Provides buffs that don’t show in total squad power (e.g., 10% energy damage resistance won’t be reflected, but it’s there).  

And in MY opinion there’s two paths to tackle Special forces.  

--------------------------------------  
⚔️ The Whale/Dolphin Route 🐋🐬 (High Spenders 💰)  

1️⃣ Push ALL the way down the skill tree to unlock Level 10 troops ASAP.  

2️⃣ After unlocking Level 10 troops, go back and max the top rows to buff your soldiers.  

This costs a LOT. Only do this if you’re ready to invest heavily.  

--------------------------------------  
🪜 Path 2 - Free to play & Mini Dolphin Route (Low spenders)  

📌 Since I don’t trust the game translator, I’ll name the rows, not the skill names.  

1️⃣ Row 1, Row 2, Row 3 → MAX (10/10).  

2️⃣ Row 4 → Leave at (1/10). Don’t waste valor badges here.  

3️⃣ Row 5 → (7/10). Important, but not urgent to max right away.  

4️⃣ Row 6 (Morale Upgrade) - (At least 7/10). This is very, very important for troop performance.  
- Once morale is at 7/10, THEN start pushing down toward Level 10 troops.  
- Only upgrade what’s necessary to get there don’t waste valor badges.  
- Alternative approach: If you don’t care about rushing Level 10 troops, max Row 5 & 6 first (morale 10/10) to make Level 9 troops as strong as possible before unlocking Level 10.  

Once Special Forces research reaches 40%, you’ll unlock:  

1️⃣ Defense Fortifications - Only upgrade the first node to unlock the fourth hospital.  

2️⃣ Siege to Seize - Personally, I’d leave this alone until after you get Level 10 troops.  

--------------------------------------  
📊 Info: Did you know the last three rows in Special Forces cost 76K Valor Badges, 11 Billion Gold, 3.6 Billion Food & Iron. Thats why Rudolph the reindeer can wait.✨  

That’s all you need to know! Upgrade wisely, don’t waste resources, and power up the right way.  

--------------------------------------  

💡 Why?  

✅ Stronger soldiers = Stronger squads = higher chances of winning.  

Skipping this? Enjoy losing fights you should’ve won. 👍  

--------------------------------------  
🚀🚀 Hero Research - Upgrade Your Heroes  

The Hero section in the Technology Center has 28 upgrades, divided into 4 categories (Tanks, Aircraft, Missile Launchers, and All Heroes Upgrades).  

1️⃣ Tanks - First 4 upgrades  
2️⃣ Aircraft - Next 4 upgrades  
3️⃣ Missiles - Following 4 upgrades  
🔁 Repeated cycle - Another 4 for each troop type (But a bit pricey this time 💰).  
4️⃣ Final 4 Upgrades - Boosts ALL Heroes  

📌 What Should You Upgrade?  

Since most of you are using Tanks (and if you’re not, act like you are for now), here’s what you need to do:  

✔️ First 4 upgrades for your squad type → MAX (5/5). No excuses. These are essential.
